# zarchiver

a thingy to retrive stuff from zenless zone zero

## making this work

im not entirely sure but you should be able to just do um

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/home/kwame/Documents/GitHub/zarchiver/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
```

and then pray that it works

if it doesnt work then idk man
